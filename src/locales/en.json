As a front-end developer, I have already gained positive professional experience working with back-end developers. I am happy to contribute my own ideas that have already improved projects while always leaving final decisions to the team or supervisors. In addition to German, I am also fluent in English and can create documentation and designs in both languages, as well as give presentations and hold in-depth discussions."
